# Numerical Methods
This is code used, mostly, as homework for the course "Métodos Numéricos" in the Q2 of 2018 at FGV/EPGE. This is a graduate course for Economics students on numerical tools to solve structural models taught by [Prof. Cezar Santos](https://sites.google.com/site/czrsantos/). You might find important information about the course on its [Wiki](http://epge.fgv.br/we/MD/MetodosNumericos/2018) page. 

Use my code as you wish. If you find the bugs, please let me know. I would appreciate any pull requests!
